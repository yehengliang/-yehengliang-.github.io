  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an experienced Quantitative Analyst with a Master of Arts in Statistics, specialized in Data Science and Statistical Finance from Columbia University. As a Quantitative Analyst at RVI Group, I build and maintain models to support Passenger Vehicle’s residual value risk analysis, conduct research on topics related to passenger vehicles, such as BEV battery leasing and battery RV, and assist in recalibration of residual value forecast and lease return rate forecast models. I am highly analytical with a strong educational background in statistics, finance, and economics, and passionate about utilizing data-driven approaches to solve complex problems.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Genetic Testing for Common Tumors</h3>
        <p>Developed a machine learning pipeline with logistic regression, elastic net, and random forest classifiers to detect real genetic features and their linkage between tumors. Preprocessed data for binary classification and led the team in dividing work and connecting the results.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>South Korea Covid-19 Cases Prediction and Variable Importance Analysis</h3>
        <p>Performed data preprocessing on various tables of 180 days SK Covid cases information, weather, policy, and location. Designed models by different model checking aspect and suggestion to obtain normal residuals for inference. Developed a ML-pipeline with Random Forest, Elastic Net, SVM Regression and LR to predict new cases on nearby locations and detect real important features. Visualized the feature importance to assist people understanding the transmission rate of Covid-19.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://rdcu.be/c8ePY" target="_blank">Functional Random Forests for Curve Response</a></h3>
        <p><em>Scientific Reports, Dec 17, 2021</em></p>
        <p>This publication introduces a novel functional random forests (FunFor) approach to model functional data response that is densely and regularly measured. The FunFor approach predicts curve responses for new observations and selects important variables from a large set of scalar predictors. It inherits the efficiency of traditional random forests in detecting complex relationships, including nonlinear and high-order interactions, without imposing parametric and distributional assumptions. The excellent performance of the FunFor approach is demonstrated in eight simulation settings and one real-data analysis. The FunFor approach has great potential for widespread application in various fields due to its minimal requirement on tuning parameters and its distribution-free and model-free nature. An R package named 'FunFor' implementing the FunFor approach is available at GitHub.</p>
